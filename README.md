# Movie Seat Booking

This is a simple **Movie Seat Booking** application built using vanilla JavaScript. The purpose of this app is to allow users to select seats for a movie and calculate the total cost based on the selected seats and ticket price. The app also remembers the selected seats and movie choice using `localStorage`, so that the data persists even when the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Select Seats**: Users can select or deselect available seats by clicking on them. Occupied seats are disabled and cannot be selected.
- **Movie Selection**: Users can select from different movie options, with each movie having a different ticket price.
- **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is dynamically updated based on the number of selected seats and the ticket price.
- **Local Storage**: The selected seats and movie choice are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that the data is retained even when the page is refreshed.
